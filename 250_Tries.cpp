Trie is a data structure that is like a tree data structure in its organisation. It consists of nodes that store letters or alphabets of words, which can be added, retrieved, and deleted from it in a very efficient way.

In other words, Trie is an information retrieval data structure, which can beat naive data structures like Hashmap, Tree, etc in the time complexity of its operations.
